# deploy/pack-for-lymedeploy.sh
# Pack the staged dist/upload/ folder into a .nupkg and push it to LymeDeploy,
# so a release publishes through the deployment pipeline instead of by hand.
#
# This is the bridge between scripts/stage-release.sh and LymeDeploy. Run it
# AFTER stage-release.sh has finished and staged dist/upload/.
#
#   ./scripts/stage-release.sh              # builds + stages dist/upload/
#   ./deploy/pack-for-lymedeploy.sh         # packs it, pushes it, tells you what's next
#
# What LymeDeploy does with it: the project's `publish-files` step extracts
# this package into the download folder on the target box, adding and
# replacing files but never pruning, with appcast.xml written strictly last
# and web.config protected. The old manual upload (drag-and-drop to
# iadev.net) and manual Cloudflare purge are what this replaces.
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/pack-for-lymedeploy.sh [--dry-run]
#
#   --dry-run   Build the .nupkg but don't push it, and report what would
#               have been pushed.
#
# The version is always read from src/Info.plist (CFBundleShortVersionString)
# — the same source of truth stage-release.sh uses — so it can't drift from
# the staged artifacts.
#
# The push needs the 'lymedeploy' CLI on PATH, configured with a server + API
# key in ~/.lymedeploy/config.json. This script never reads that file.

# neither is present on the Mac, and this package has no project to pack — it
# is a folder of already-built, already-notarized artifacts. A .nupkg is just
# a zip with a .nuspec in it, and LymeDeploy reads identity from that .nuspec
# and unzips the rest.
#
# Payload files go at the ROOT of the archive, because the agent publishes the
# root of the extraction into the target directory after stripping the NuGet
# envelope ([Content_Types].xml, *.nuspec). A file in a subfolder here would
# land in a subfolder of the download directory and 404.
